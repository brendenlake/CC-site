# Categories and Concepts - Fall 2019

**Instructor**: [Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/)  
Assistant Professor of Psychology and Data Science  
New York University  
brenden@nyu.edu  

**Meeting time and location**:  
Monday 2:00-3:50 PM  
Meyer Room 851 (6 Washington Place)

**Course numbers**:  
PSYCH-GA 3405.001 (Psychology)  

**Office hours**:  
Wednesdays 3:50-5:00pm, or by appointment; 6 Washington Place, Room 858

**Summary**: This course introduces the major topics in the psychology of concepts, focusing on issues of concept representation and use. The first part of the course discusses the main theories of concepts, including the classic view, prototype models, exemplar models, and the knowledge view. We will also spend several weeks discussing computational models that implement these theories, focusing on the neural network and Bayesian modeling traditions. The second part of the course will cover other key topics including taxonomic categories, category-based induction, conceptual development, categorical percpetion, and conceptual combination. The readings will be drawn from the textbook and classic papers in the field. The course will be in a lecture-discussion format. 

Please note that this syllabus is not final and there may be further adjustments.

I am grateful to [Greg Murphy](https://psych.nyu.edu/murphy/) for developing this first version of this class and, of course, writing the "The Big Book of Concepts" that we use as our textbook.

## Textbook
We will be using Greg Murphy's "The Big Book of Concepts" as the textbook for this class. We will also draw original research articles. You can get the book from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Concepts-Bradford-Books-Press-ebook/dp/B001KW0APW), and it also should be available from the NYU bookstore.

## Pre-requisites
- This course is for graduate students in cognitive science and related fields. All students are expected to have previous coursework in psychology.
- Computational modeling has been central to the study of concepts and categories, and this version of the course includes more computational modeling than previous versions. I want this to be a positive for everyone interested in the course, and I will not assume you have a lot of experience with computational modeling. I will try to make the material as understandable as possible, even though we will not have time to cover the basics of cognitive modeling. If you have taken "Computational cognitive modeling," you're in a great position; if you have had linear algebra and statistics as an undergraduate, you will also be in the a good position to understand the modeling details. If you don't have either, don't fret! This course does not require programming or implementing computational models, and I hope you find this aspects of the class interesting regardless of your background.
- Again, computer programming will not be used in this course.

## Grading
Grading will be based on the response papers (35%) and a final paper (65%). Class participation will be used to decide grades in borderline cases. As we only meet once a week, class attendance is obviously important.

### Responses to the reading
Each week you will write a mini-paper (about 4-5 paragraphs or ~800 words) in which you will critique the week's readings, discuss an issue raised by it, or propose a new experiment based on it. The main purpose of these responses is to get you to: 1) do the reading on time so we can talk about it, and 2) think about the reading. In the responses, please focus on what issues are most important or interesting and to think about, and what questions are unresolved in the field. Do not give a list of minor questions or flaws. You may skip one weekly response, but any other missed ones will need to be made up. Post your response to the class Piazza page before class (the night before would be preferred). Your responses will be graded on a check-plus, check, or check-minus basis, with most responses receiving a check.

### Final paper
The final paper should address one of the topics covered in the class in more detail. Alternatively, it could investigate a topic that was not covered in class. To make sure your paper is headed for success, you should write-up a proposal for your final paper due on TBD (one half page written). Submit via email with the file name lastname-cc-proposal.pdf (brenden@nyu.edu). You can also dicuss your topic with me during office hours. The paper should include a critical review of the literature, along with theoretical conclusions or suggestions for future research. I would expect papers to be about 12 pages long, though the exact length is not as important as the quality of thought the paper reveals. 

## Course discussion  
We will be using Piazza for reactions to readings and class discussion.
