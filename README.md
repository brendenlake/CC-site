# Advancing AI through cognitive science - Spring 2019

**Instructor**: [Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/)  
Assistant Professor of Psychology and Data Science  
New York University

**Meeting time and location**:  
Thursday 4-5:50 PM  
Meyer Room 465 (4 Washington Place)

**Course numbers**:  
PSYCH-GA 3405.001 (Psychology)  
DS-GA 3001.013 (Data Science)

**Office hours**:  
Wednesdays 10-11:00 am, or by appointment; 60 5th Ave., Room 610

**Summary**: Why are people smarter than machines? This course explores how the study of human intelligence can inform and improve artificial intelligence. We will look to cognitive science, with special focus on cognitive development, to help elucidate a set of "key ingredients" that are important components of human learning and thought, but are either underutilized or absent in contemporary artificial intelligence. Through readings and discussion, we will cover ingredients such as "intuitive physics," "intuitive psychology," "compositionality," "causality," and "learning-to-learn," although students will be encouraged to contribute other ingredients. Each ingredient will be discussed and compared from the perspectives of both cognitive science and AI, with readings drawn from both fields with roughly a 50/50 proportion.

_This is a small discussion-based seminar, so please come ready to participate in the discussion._ Please note that this syllabus is not final and there may be further adjustments.

## Pre-requisites
- This course is intended for graduate students in cognitive science or graduate students in data science / AI. 
- Students are _not expected to have a background in both cognitive science and AI_. Instead, students may have experience in one field and the desire to learn about the other. Ideally, at the end of the course, students will have a deeper appreciation of contemporary issues in both fields and their potential for synergy.
- At minimum, it would be very good to have taken a graduate level psychology course, OR a graduate level machine learning / AI course. If you have taken neither, this probably not the right course for you.
- _Programming is not a requirement for this course, although students may choose to incorporate programming in their final project._

## Grading
The final grade is based on the final paper or project (50%), written reactions to the reading (25%), and participating in discussions (25%).

The final paper or project is done individually. For the final assignment, students may either write a final paper that proposes an additional ingredient of human intelligence that is underutilized in AI, or complete a project that implements one of the ingredients discussed in an algorithm. The final assignment proposal is due on Thursday, April 4 (one half page written). The final assignment is due on Tuesday, May 14.

**What makes a good reaction post?** There are many ways to write a good reaction post, and I would rather leave it up to you than impose a particular formula. Try to articulate an opinion about the readings, rather than write an exhaustive summary of the articles. I prefer to read your opinions than a summary! It's great if you can put the articles in conversation with each other and with the theme of the class. It's also okay to focus on one or two of the readings that interest you most, rather than talking about each of the readings equally.

The responses should be short -- three short paragraphs is about right. I don't want the reaction to take much of your time beyond reading the articles themselves (15 mins is reasonable for writing your response).

## Course discussion  
We will be using Piazza for reactions to readings and class discussion.

The signup link for our Piazza page is available here ([https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2019/psychga3405001](https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2019/psychga3405001)).

Once signed up, our class Piazza page is available here ([https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2019/psychga3405001/home](https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2019/psychga3405001/home)).

## Final assignment
- The final assignment is due Tuesday, May 14.
- You will also be asked to give a 5 minute presentation on your final project on Thursday May, 9.
- The final paper or project is done individually (not as a group). 
- Option 1: A final paper that proposes an additional ingredient of human intelligence that is underutilized in AI. The paper should summarize the psychological literature on the ingredient, and discuss the relevant AI literature or lack thereof (about 8 pages)
- Option 2: Complete a project that implements an important aspect of one of the ingredients discussed in class (intuitive physics, intuitive psychology, compositionality etc.) in an algorithm (with a 4 page writeup)
- If you can link the project to your research, that's encouraged!
- The final assignment proposal is due on Thursday, April 4 (one half page written). Submit via email with the file name lastname-aai-proposal.pdf (brenden@nyu.edu).
- Please submit final assignment via email (brenden@nyu.edu) with the file name lastname-aai-final.pdf

## Detailed schedule and readings
Please see below for the assigned readings for each class (to be read before class). Before each class, students will be asked to submit a reaction to the readings (three paragraphs). Reaction posts are submitted via Piazza. Papers are available for download on NYU Classes in the "Resources" folder. Reactions are due by midnight the day before class so that I have time to read the reactions.
