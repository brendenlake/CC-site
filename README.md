# Categories and Concepts - Fall 2019

**Instructor**: [Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/)  
Assistant Professor of Psychology and Data Science  
New York University

**Meeting time and location**:  
Monday 2:00-3:50 PM  
Meyer Room 851 (6 Washington Place)

**Course numbers**:  
PSYCH-GA 3405.001 (Psychology)  

**Office hours**:  
Wednesdays 3:50-5:00pm, or by appointment; 6 Washington Place, Room 858

**Summary**: This class introduces the major topics in the psychology of concepts. The focus will be on central issues of concept representation and use. The first part of the course will discuss the major theories of concepts, including the classic view, prototype models, exemplar models, and concepts as theories. We will also spend several weeks discussing computational implementations of these theories, focused mostly on the neural network and Bayesian modeling traditions. The second part of the course covers other key topics such as taxonomic categories, category-based induction, conceptual development, categorical percpetion, and words as concepts. The readings will be drawn from the textbook and classic papers in the field. The course will be in a lecture-discussion format. 

Please note that this syllabus is not final and there may be further adjustments.

I am grateful to [Greg Murphy](https://psych.nyu.edu/murphy/) for developing this first version of this class and, of course, writing the "Big Book of Concepts" that we use as our textbook.

## Pre-requisites
- This course is for graduate students in cognitive science and related fields.
- Computational modeling has been central to the study of concepts and categories, and this version of the course includes more computational modeling than in previous versions. I want this to be encouraging as a reason to take the course (rather than discouraging), and I will not assume you have a lot of experience with computational modeling. We will not have time to cover the foundational material for all of the models discussed in class, but I will try to make the material as understandable as possible. If you have taken "Computational cognitive modeling" you're in a great position, but it's not necessary; if you have had linear algebra and probability theory as an undergraduate, you will also be in the a good position to understand the modeling details. If not, don't fret, this course does not require programming or implementing any models, and I hope you find this material interesting nonetheless.
- Programming is not a requirement for this course.

## Grading
Grading will be based on the response papers (35%) and a final paper (65%).

### Responses to the reading
Each week you will write a mini-paper (about 4-5 paragraphs or ~800 words) in which you will critique the week's readings, discuss an issue raised by it, or propose a new experiment based on it. The main purpose of these responses is to get you to: 1) do the reading on time so we can talk about it, and 2) think about the reading. In the responses, please focus on what issues are most important or interesting and to think about, and what questions are unresolved in the field. Do not give a list of minor questions or flaws. You may skip one weekly response, but any other missed ones will need to be made up. Post your response to the class Piazza page before class (the night before would be preferred). Your responses will be graded on a check-plus, check, or check-minus basis, with most responses receiving a check.

### Final paper
The final paper should address one of the topics covered in the class in more detail. Alternatively, it could investigate a topic that was not covered in class. In either case, it is essential that you discuss the topic with me in advance. The paper should include a critical review of the literature, along with theoretical conclusions or suggestions for future research. I would expect papers to be about 15 pages long, though the exact length is not as important as the quality of the thought the paper reveals. Class participation will be used to decide grades in borderline cases.

## Course discussion  
We will be using Piazza for reactions to readings and class discussion.
