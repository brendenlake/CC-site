# Categories and Concepts - Fall 2019

**Instructor**: [Brenden Lake](https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/)  
Assistant Professor of Psychology and Data Science  
New York University

**Meeting time and location**:  
Monday 2-3:50 PM  
Meyer Room 851 (6 Washington Place)

**Course numbers**:  
PSYCH-GA 3405.001 (Psychology)  

**Office hours**:  
Wednesdays 3:50-5pm, or by appointment; 6 Washington Place, Room 858

**Summary**: This class will introduce the major topics in the psychology of concepts. The focus will be on central issues of concept representation and use. The first part of the course will discuss the traditional questions in the psychology of concepts, such as the prototype-exemplar debate. Then we will address more recent approaches that have emphasized that concepts are integrated with general knowledge. The final part of the course will consider evidence from neuropsychology. We shall spend three weeks on specifically developmental issues, spread throughout the course. The readings are primarily classic papers in the field, rather than secondary sources. The course will be in a lecture-discussion format. Since the class only meets once a week, attendance is obviously very important.

Please note that this syllabus is not final and there may be further adjustments.

## Pre-requisites
- This course is intended for graduate students in cognitive science and related fields.
- Programming is not a requirement for this course.

## Grading
Grading will be based on the mini-papers and a final paper.

### Response papers
Each week you will write a mini-paper (1-2 pages long) in which you will critique the day’s reading, discuss an issue raised by it, or propose a new experiment based on it. The main purpose of this assignment is to get you to 1. do the reading on time, so we can talk about it, and 2. think about the reading. The goal of the paper is to get you to focus on what issues are most important or interesting and to think about what questions are yet unresolved in the field. Do not give a list of minor questions or flaws. You may skip one weekly mini-paper; any other missed ones must be made up. Email me the paper before class (the night before would be better). They will be graded on a check-plus, check, or check-minus basis, with the ordinary good paper receiving a check.

### Final paper
The final paper should address one of the issues covered in the class in more detail. Alternatively, it could investigate a topic that was not covered in class. In either case, it is essential that you discuss the topic with me in advance. The paper should include a critical review of the literature, along with theoretical conclusions or suggestions for future research. I would expect papers to be about 15 pages long, though the exact length is not as important as the quality of the thought the paper reveals. Class participation will be used to decide grades in borderline cases.

## Course discussion  
We will be using Piazza for reactions to readings and class discussion.

The signup link for our Piazza page is available here ([https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2019/psychga3405001](https://piazza.com/nyu/spring2019/psychga3405001)).

## Detailed schedule and readings
Please see below for the assigned readings for each class (to be read before class). Before each class, students will be asked to submit a reaction to the readings (three paragraphs). Reaction posts are submitted via Piazza. Papers are available for download on NYU Classes in the "Resources" folder. Reactions are due by midnight the day before class so that I have time to read the reactions.
